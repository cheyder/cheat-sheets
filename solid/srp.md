The SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) is often misunderstood because of its name: It's not about a module having only one purpose. (This principle is used for functions: a function got one, and only one, job.) 

The SRP is more about a module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor. (see Martin 2018, Ch. 7)
